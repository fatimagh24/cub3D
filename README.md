# üåÄ Cub3D ‚Äì Maze Runner

> ‚ÄúThe maze isn‚Äôt just walls... it‚Äôs a test of logic, math, and imagination.‚Äù

---

Cub3D ‚Äì **Maze Runner** is a 3D maze exploration project developed in **C** using the **MiniLibX** graphical library as part of the **42 Amman curriculum**.  
The goal is to build a **raycasting engine** that transforms a 2D map into a fully interactive 3D world ‚Äî inspired by classic first-person games like *Wolfenstein 3D*.  

You wake up inside a mysterious maze. The only way out? Follow the paths you create with your code.

## üéÆ About the Project

Cub3D reads a `.cub` file containing the maze layout, textures, and colors, and renders it in 3D using **raycasting**.  
The player can move, rotate, and explore the environment freely, with each wall and color dynamically drawn based on position and direction.

The project focuses on:
- Implementing **raycasting** from scratch  
- Rendering **walls**, **textures**, and **colored floors/ceilings**  
- Managing **keyboard input** and **real-time movement**  
- Parsing and validating **map files**  
- Practicing **mathematics, logic, and low-level graphics programming**

- `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`: texture paths for each wall  
- `F`, `C`: floor and ceiling colors in RGB  
- Map grid: `1` = wall, `0` = space, `N` = player‚Äôs start position
